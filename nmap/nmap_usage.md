# 🌐 ARP        TCP/IP Link Layer 🌐
- ARP scan usually requires privileged user to access because ARP requests and responses involve low-level network operations. 
- sudo nmap -PR -sn IP_ADDRESS/24
- **"-PR"** means that only ARP scans will be performed.
- **-sn** discover online hosts without live-port scanning.
## Arp Scan Tool
- Installation: *apt install arp-scan*
- *arp-scan* provides customization of your scan.
-  *--localnet* or *-l* -> sends ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local network.
- *-I* parameter usage when there is more than one *interface*
## Examples:
- sudo arp-scan -l/--localnet IP_ADDRESS/24
- sudo arp-scan -I eth0/tun0 -l IP_ADDRESS/24
- sudo arp-scan IP_ADDRESS/24
- **same approach:** sudo nmap -PR -sn IP_ADDRESS/24

# 🌐 ICMP       OSI Network Layer (5) 🌐
- You can ping every ip addresses on network using:
Echo **Request**: **ping (ICMP Type 8/Echo)**
Echo **Respond**: **ping (ICMP Type 0)**
- Method is not always *trustworthy*
Many firewalls block ICMP echo; new versions of MS Windows are configured with a host firewall that blocks ICMP echo requests by default.
If you are on the same subnet with target, *ARP* will perform scan instead of ICMP.
- *ICMP echo request* discovery: **nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24**
This scan will send *ICMP echo packets* to every IP_ADDRESS on the subnet. 
**Notice:** Many firewalls block *ICMP*
**We may not expect to find MAC addresses on the scan results.**

## Extra Information on parameters

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 "-A" Parameter </strong></summary>

- Known as **Aggresive Mode**
- Fast Scan using **-T4** 
- Auto OS detection **-O**
- Service Detection **-sV**
- Pingless Scanning **-Pn**
- Most common *100* ports **-F**
- Traceroute between host and target **--traceroute**
- NSE Scripting utility **-sC**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 "-Pn" Parameter </strong></summary>

- Bypassing the noisy **ICMP probes** that could trigger alerts.
- You can better assess your **Network's defenses**
- Enabling you to gather information **without alerting the defenders.**
- You can verify whether your security measures are effectively **blocking unauthorized access** attemps
- **Ethical Consideration**: Using -Pn without proper authorization can be seen as an aggressive action and might lead to unintended consequences.

### TCP FIN, NULL, and Xmas Scans

These three scan types, exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP RFC(793) to differentiate between open and closed ports.
The key advantage to these scan types is that they can sneak through certain non-stateful firewalls and packet filtering routers.
Another advantage is that these scan types are a little more stealthy than even a SYN scan

### Null scan (-sN)

- Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0).

### FIN scan (-sF)

- Sets just the TCP FIN bit.

### Xmas scan (-sX)

- Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree.

| Probe Response | Assigned State |
|----------|-------------|
| No response received (even after retransmissions) | open|filtered |
| TCP RST packet | closed |
| ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) | filtered|
